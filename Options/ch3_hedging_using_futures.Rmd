## Basic Principles

* A *short hedge* is a hedge that involves a short position in futures contract. A short hedge is appropriate when the hedger already owns an asset and expects to sell it at some time in the future.
* A *long hedge* involves taking a long position in futures contract. A long hedge is appropriate when a company knows it will have to purchase a certain asset in the future and wants to lock in a price now.
