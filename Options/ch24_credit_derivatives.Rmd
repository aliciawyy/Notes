* Single-name : The most popular type is a *credit default swap*, it is a contract that provides insurance against the risk of a default by a particular company.
    - The company is known as a *reference entity*.
    - A default by the company is known as a *credit event*.
    - The total amount paid per year, as a percent of the notional principal to buy protection is known as the *CDS spread*.
* Multi-name : The most popular type is a *collateralized debt obligation*. In this, a portfolio of debt instruments is specified and a complex structure is created where the cash flows from the portfolio are channelled to different categories of investors.
