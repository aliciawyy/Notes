Chapter 10 Properties of Stock Options
======================================

There are six factors affecting the price of a stock option

1. The current stock price $S_0$
2. The strike price $K$
3. The time to expiration $T$
4. The volatility of the stock price $\sigma$ : it is a measure of uncertainty.
5. The risk-free interest rate $r$
6. The dividends that are expected to be paid

**Put-call parity**
$$
c + Ke^{-rT} = p + S_0
$$

Chapter 11 Binomial Trees
=========================

The *risk-neutral* investors do not increase the expected return they require from an investment to compensate for increased risk.

A risk-neutral world has two features

- The expected return on a stock (or any other investment) is the risk-free rate.
- The discount rate used for the expected payoff on an option (or any other instrument) is the risk-free rate.
