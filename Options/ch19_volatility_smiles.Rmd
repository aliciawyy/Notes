The *implied volatility* is the volatility that makes the Black-Scholes-Merton price of an option equal to its market price. It is calculated using an iterative method.

A plot of the implied volatility of an option with a certain life as a function of its strike price is known as a *volatility smile*.


Chapter 21 Value at Risk
========================

When using the value-at-risk measure, an analyst is interested in making a statement of the following form

> I am X percent certain there will be a loss of more than V dollars in th the next N days.

* X: confidence level
* V: the VaR of the portfolio
* N: the time horizon(N days). An usual assumption is : $N$-day VaR = 1-day VaR $\times \sqrt{N}$

There are two main approaches to calculate it

* Historical simulation
* Model building

**Def.** *Daily volatility* $\sigma_{day} =\sigma_{year}/\sqrt{252}$
