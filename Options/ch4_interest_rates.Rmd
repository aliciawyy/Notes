Suppose that an amount $A$ is invested for $n$ years at an interest rate of $R$ per annum. If the rate is *compounded* once per annum, the terminal value of the investment is $$A(1+R)^n$$

If the rate is compounded $m$ times per annum, the terminal value of the investment is $$A(1+ \dfrac{R}{m})^{mn}$$

When $m = 1$, the rate is sometimes referred to as *equivalent annual interest rate*.

When the compounding frequency $m \rightarrow \inf$, the limit is known as *continuous compounding*
$$
\lim_{m \rightarrow \inf} A(1+ \dfrac{R}{m})^{mn} = Ae^{Rn}
$$
