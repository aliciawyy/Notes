Suppose that an amount $A$ is invested for $n$ years at an interest rate of $R$ per annum. If the rate is *compounded* once per annum, the terminal value of the investment is $$A(1+R)^n$$

If the rate is compounded $m$ times per annum, the terminal value of the investment is $$A(1+ \dfrac{R}{m})^{mn}$$

When $m = 1$, the rate is sometimes referred to as *equivalent annual interest rate*.

When the compounding frequency $m \rightarrow \inf$, the limit is known as *continuous compounding*
$$
\lim_{m \rightarrow \inf} A(1+ \dfrac{R}{m})^{mn} = Ae^{Rn}
$$

For most practical purposes, continuous compounding can be thought of as being quivalent to daily compounding.

Suppose that $R_c$ is a rate of interest with continuous compounding and $R_m$ is the equivalent rate with compounding $m$ times per annum. So that we can convert one to the other with
$$
Ae^{R_c n} = A(1+ \dfrac{R_m}{m})^{mn} \Rightarrow e^{R_c} = (1+ \dfrac{R_m}{m})^m
$$
Thus
$$
R_c = m \ln(1+ \dfrac{R_m}{m}) \qquad R_m = m(e^{R_c/m} - 1)
$$

**Def.** The n-year *zero rate* is the rate of interes earned on an investment that starts today and lasts for n years. All the interest and principal is realized at the end of n years, there is no intermediate payments.

## Bonds Pricing

Most bounds pay coupons to the holder periodically. The bond's principal (which is also known as is *par value* or *face value*) is paid at the end of its life.

*The theoretical price* of a bond = the present value of all the cash flows that will be received by the owner

A *bond yield* is the single discount rate that, when applied to all cash flows, gives a bond price equal to its market price.

The *par yield* for a certain bond maturity is the coupon rate that causes the bond price to equal its par value.
