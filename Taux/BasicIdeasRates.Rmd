# Basic Concepts of Interest Rates
(Ref. Interest Rate Models : Theory and practice)

There are different types of interest rates, and a first distinction can be made between _interbank rates_ and _government rates_.

* Government rates are usually deduced by bonds issued by governments.
* By interbank rates we denote rates at which deposits are exchanged between banks. (ex. LIBOR)
