C++ defines the creation order as follows: (Destruction is in reverse order)

1. If the class has a base class, **the default constructor of the base class** is executed.
2. **Non-static data members** of the class are constructed in the order in which they were declared. 
3. THe body of **the class's constructor** is executed.

Note that the destructors are all `virtual`. If not, it can become a problem when a child object is accessed as a pointer to a parent and deleted. For example,
```
Parent* ptr = new Child();
delete ptr;
```
The above code will construct the `Child` object in the creation order explained, but it will only call the destructor of `Parent` is the destructor of the class `Parent` is not declared `virtual`.
