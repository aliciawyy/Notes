The `std::map` store key/value pairs where *insertion, lookup and deletion* are all based on the key and the value is just along the ride.

The `map` keeps elements in sorted order, based on the keys, so that *insertion, deletion and lookup* all take **logarithmic time**. It is usually implemented as some form of balanced tree.
